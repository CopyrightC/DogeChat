DogeChat is the sequel to [GUI-Chat-app](https://github.com/SATAN01/GUI-chat-app), having many more features
like group chatting, Settings page, main-menu, support for different resoulutions unlike most other tkinter made GUIs etc.

# How do you use DogeChat?
It's pretty straightforward, you can create/join chat rooms easily and chat with your friends!

# How do I run it on my machine?

*Make sure you have **python 3.6 +***

Open up your terminal and run the following sequence of commands

(For setting up server)
```
git clone https://github.com/SATAN01/DogeChat
cd DogeChat
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd Server
python server.py
```

(For client; **Make sure you change the ip in clinet.py!**)
```
git clone https://github.com/SATAN01/DogeChat
cd DogeChat
pip install -r requirements.txt
python register.py
```
If you want to run this globally , you need [forward ports](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67596766/how-could-we-establish-connection-between-server-and-client-through-socket-progr/67597468?noredirect=1#comment119731269_67597468)
